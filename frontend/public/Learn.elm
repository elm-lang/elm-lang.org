# Learn

The [syntax reference](/learn/Syntax.elm) is a good place to start.
The [examples page](/Examples.elm) is intended to help you learn by
example, slowly building up skills. This page provides more in-depth
documentation.

### General Resources

* [FAQ](/learn/FAQ.elm) &mdash; frequently asked questions, organized by who tends to ask them

### Building Blocks

* [Understanding Types](/learn/Understanding-Types.elm) &mdash; primitive values, data structures, and functions
* [Union Types](/learn/Union-Types.elm) &mdash; mixing different kinds of values
* [Records](/learn/Records.elm) &mdash; values with named fields, sort of like objects

### Signals

* [Key Concepts](/learn/What-is-FRP.elm) &mdash; key concepts behind signals
* [Using Signals](/learn/Using-Signals.elm) &mdash; common patterns and pitfalls
* [Inputs](/learn/Interactive-UI-Elements.elm) &mdash; working with text fields, check boxes, etc.
* [Architecting large programs](/learn/Architecture.elm) &mdash; how to use signals as programs get larger

### Interop

* [HTML in Elm][elm-html] &mdash; making HTML faster and simpler
* [Elm in HTML](/learn/Components.elm) &mdash; put any Elm program in any div
