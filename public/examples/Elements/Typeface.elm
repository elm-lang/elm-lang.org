{-- More Information on Typefaces -----------------------------------

The typeface provided is a comma separated list of possible options.
Each typeface is tried (left-to-right) until one is found that is
available on the client machine. So you do not need to specify
multiple typefaces, but it is a good policy, just in case someone
is missing the typeface you want.

Look into the CSS font-family property to learn more.
